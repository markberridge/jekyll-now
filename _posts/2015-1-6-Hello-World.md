title: Hello World!
---

A coding Architect living in Sheffield, UK; I've been designing, building and testing software professionally since 1999. I'm currently working at learndirect, building a micro-service based web platform using Linux, Puppet, Java, AngularJS and REST technologies. I'm passionate about building software which, while clean, testable and maintainable, is designed to meet end-user needs and is fit for operational use. I am an agile evangelist dedicated to affect organisational change by delivering solutions driven out of close collaboration.
