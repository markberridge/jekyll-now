I'm a coding architect in Sheffield, UK.  I've been designing software and writing code professionally since 1999.  I currently work at learndirect building an eAssessment platform using Linux, Java, JavaScript and HTML5 technologies.  I'm passionate about building software with clean, testable and maintainable code which is designed for operational use.
